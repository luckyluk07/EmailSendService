<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The main purpose of this application was to create Email Send Service based on Spring Boot. 
Application allows to store data about user (id, username, email) in database. It contains REST API which allows CRUD operations on Users, REST API which allows to get 
and update emails from users and REST API which allows to send email to one or all users from repository.
User of this service can store data about users (containing email), delete users, update user or email, create user with email and fetch users or emails. He can also
send mail to all users from repository, or to selected one.

It is Spring Boot REST API. Maven is used to download and manage dependencies. Data are saved with in-memory H2 database.
Interactive documentation is generated by Swagger. Thanks to Lombok, the repetitive code has been replaced by appropriate annotations.
JUnit is used to test services and controllers. 


### Mainly Built With
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Quick start Spring Framework web applications
* [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) - The Java SQL database
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Reduce repeatable code
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - Generate REST API documentation
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) - Testing


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, for development and testing purposes.
